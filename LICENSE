COPYING -- Describes the terms under which Nuttx is distributed. A copy of
the BSD-style licensing is included in this file. In my words -- I believe
that you should free to use NuttX in any environment, private, private,
commercial, open, closed, etc. provided only that you respect the modest
copyright notices as described in license (below), respect Trademarks, and
include a copy of the BSD license.  Please feel free to contact me if you
have any licensing concerns.

Copyright Date Notation:  Copyright information is provided in the header
of each file.  This copyright information includes the name of the copyright
holder and the year(s) in which copyrighted additions to the file were made
to the file.  A comma (',') is used to separate years in the list of years.
A hyphen ('-') is used as a more compact notation when additions were made
over several consecutive years.  So for example, "2007, 2011" would mean
that copyrighted additions were made during the years of 2007 and 2011
whereas "2007-2011" would indicate copyrighted additions in the years 2007,
2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Copyright Line Continuation:  Copy information which exceeds the usable line
lengh may be broken and continued on the following line, such as:
